# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# categories = Category.create([{name: "Housework", icon: "fa fa-home"}, {name: "Personal", icon: "glyphicon glyphicon-user"}, {name: "Errands", icon: "fa fa-shopping-bag"}, {name: "Miscellaneous", icon: "glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"}])
